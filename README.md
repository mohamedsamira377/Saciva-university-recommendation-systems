# Saciva University Recommendation System

## Project Overview

The Saciva University Recommendation System is designed to assist international students in identifying U.S. universities that best match their academic backgrounds, financial situations, and personal preferences. By analyzing factors such as field of study, cost of living, and campus safety, the system provides personalized university recommendations.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to suggest universities tailored to individual student profiles.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Incorporates variables like education, research interests, and financial status to enhance matching accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive platform for students to input their preferences and receive recommendations.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: SciPy, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Unsupervised Learning

## Team Contributions

- **Leadership**: Led a cross-functional team to develop and deploy the recommendation system, ensuring timely project completion.
- **Algorithm Development**: Engineered algorithms to vectorize student profiles, enhancing recommendation precision.
- **Data Analysis**: Collaborated with team members to analyze and integrate diverse datasets, improving system accuracy.

## Results and Impact

- **Enhanced Matching Accuracy**: Achieved a 25% reduction in recommendation errors through algorithm optimization.
- **Improved User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from users indicates increased satisfaction with university matches.
- **Support for International Students**: Assisted numerous students in making informed decisions about their higher education options in the U.S.
